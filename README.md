Uses a conditional GAN with discriminator of 2C classes for real and fake to hallucinate missing features for hyperspectral or multimodal data using available features.

Generator takes latent dimensions as well as input from available modality to generate features.
GAN was trained using tips from https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks
Hallucinated features are concatenated with original and sent through to classifier.
