# Feature Hallucination Using Conditional GAN

### Implementation of the paper - [**An Adversarial Approach to Discriminative Modality Hallucination for Remote Sensing Data**](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/CROMOL/Pande_An_Adversarial_Approach_to_Discriminative_Modality_Distillation_for_Remote_Sensing_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf) - IEEE ICCV - CROMOL 2019 in TensorFlow


Uses a conditional GAN with novel discriminator of _2C_ classes (corresponsing to _C_ real and fake classes each) to hallucinate missing features for hyperspectral or multimodal remote sensing data using available sensor derived features.

Generator takes latent dimensions as well as conditional input from available modality to generate missing features.
GAN was trained using tips from Soumith Chintala's [GANHacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks).

Deep CNNs have been utilized as feature extractors for application of GAN, and further classification.
Hallucinated features are concatenated with original features and sent to DNN classifier.

Ablation studies done with Indian Pines dataset.
